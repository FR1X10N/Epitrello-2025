# Epitrello-2025

This project was completed during my second year at Epitech as part of my internship catch-up.

## Description

Epitrello is a web application inspired by Trello. The goal of the project is to recreate the main features of collaborative task and board management: creating boards, adding lists, managing cards, moving and editing items, as well as enabling real-time collaboration between users. This project aims to provide an experience similar to Trello, tailored to the educational and technical requirements of the Epitech curriculum.


## How it works

This project uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for web development. To start the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the result.

You can edit the main page by modifying the `app/page.js` file. Changes are applied automatically.

For more information about Next.js and deployment, see the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).

## Reference to Trello and its API

Epitrello draws inspiration from [Trello](https://trello.com), a popular collaborative task management tool. While Epitrello is not directly connected to Trello, developers interested in integrating with Trello's ecosystem can explore [Trello's API documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/). The API provides extensive capabilities for managing boards, lists, and cards programmatically.
